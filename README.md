# RestLibrary

More often than not, when we need to talk to some kind of REST Endpoints, we end up doing the same boilerplate activities: perform OAuth login, set authorization header, make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP calls with objects that need to be serialized/deserialized in JSON format.

*RestLibrary* aims to greatly simplify all these tasks: it is a lightweight library to perform common REST API calls.
